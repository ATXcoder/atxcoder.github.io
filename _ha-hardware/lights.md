## :bulb: Phillips Hue
**Integration:** [Phillips Hue Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hue)

I have several Hue White Lamp bulbs in lamps, dining room, bathroom, etc. These bulbs are handy as many of my light fixtures do not have a neutral wire.

## :bulb: WLED
**Integration:** [WLED Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wled)

I have an ESP8266-D1 connected to a small strip of LEDs in my office running [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/). WLED is an awesome firmware that lets you control NeoPixel LEDs and provides hundreds of effects, OTA updates, and a ton of other useful options. This summer I will be adding some to my pool outside for some cool night swimming!
