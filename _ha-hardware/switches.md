## ZWave
**Integration:**

I use a [Zooz Z-Wave Plus Wall Dimmer Switch](https://a.co/d/b66mjvN) in our master bathroom that controls our recessed dimmable can lights.

## Shelly One Relay

I have a [Shelly One relay](https://a.co/d/fDxZtFz) connected to our front porch light and the TV in my office. These relays work with MQTT (which I run as an add-on in Home Assistant) and have been rock solid for years. They are small enough to fit in a standard light switch box and just work.
