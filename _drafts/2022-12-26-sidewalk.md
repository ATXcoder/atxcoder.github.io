## Steps
1. Go into **Front Orthographic View** [`Ctrl + Numpad 1`], select the cube, and **Grab** [`g`] and move it along the Z-axis. You want to move it 1 meter up (you can just type in 1 to move it exactly 1 meter)

<i class='far fa-thumbs-up'></i> **Tip:** You can constrain the movement of an object along a particular axis by pressing the corresponding axis key. For example, to move the object along the Z-axis you would press the `z` key immediately after pressing the `g` key (the keyboard shortcut for grab)
