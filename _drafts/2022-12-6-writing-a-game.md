I always thought that it would be cool to write a video game. The coding, storytelling, creating game assets, all of it just always seemed like it would be a cool job.

Over the years I have tried once or twice to get started but always seemed to never really get anywhere. I think the overall task of creating a game just felt daunting and it wasn't until I watched a [documentary about Indie game developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B9Jyp7nCNw) Thomas Brush that I felt like maybe creating a game was something that I could do.

So I have decided that this year, 2023, will be the year that I truly start the journey of becoming an Indie Game Developer. I plan to have a game out by the end of 2023. Most likely it will be something simple and small, but a game nonetheless.

In addition to writing a game, I have decided to log my journey on this blog. I hope that not only will it be a good way to chronicle my journey, but maybe even inspire others to start their journeys as well.
