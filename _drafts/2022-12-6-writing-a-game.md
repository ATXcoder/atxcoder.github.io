I always thought that it would be cool to actually write my own video games. The coding, story telling, creating game assets, all of it just always seemed like it would be a cool job.

Over the years I have tried once or twice to get started but always seemed to never really get anywhere. I think the overall task of creating a game just felt really daunting and it wasn't until I watched a [documentary about a indie game developer Thomas Brush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B9Jyp7nCNw) that I felt like maybe creating a game was something that I could do.

So I have decided that this year, 2023, will be the year that I truly start the journey of becoming a Indie Game Developer. My plan is to have a game out by the end of 2023. Most likely it will be something simple and small, but a game none the less.

In addition to writing a game, I have decided to log my journey on this blog. I hope that not only will it be a good way to chronicle my journey, but maybe even inspire others to start their own journeys as well.
